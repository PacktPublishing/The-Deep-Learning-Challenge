# The Deep Learning Challenge [Video]
This is the code repository for [The Deep Learning Challenge [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/deep-learning-challenge-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781789801484), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Deep learning is a powerful set of modern Machine Learning methods that achieve excellent results in fields like Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing. The goal of this course is to challenge you to take the most common problems that you will see in those fields and test your Deep Learning skills using real world examples.

The first part of the course is based on solving the basic problems in Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing. Then in the second part of the course we will focus on more complex challenges that use less common methods and components.  
And the end of this course you will know how to solve the most common Deep Learning problems in both Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing fields.
